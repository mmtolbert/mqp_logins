  - if you want to run this as an active site, redirect port 80 to 3010 in your iptables rules
  - remaining controls are guided prompts in the terminal running the server
- IMPORTANT: Not designed to support multiple simultaneous clients (this could be added fairly easily but was outside of scope)
